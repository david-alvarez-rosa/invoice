** Localization
Currently, only English and Spanish are supported.  For Spanish, simply
load the =babel= package:
#+begin_src latex
  \usepackage[spanish]{babel}
#+end_src

Support for other languages can be easily added if needed
#+begin_src latex
  \AtBeginDocument{%
    \ifthenelse{\equal{\languagename}{spanish}}{%
      \renewcommand{\titletext}{FACTURA}
      \renewcommand{\descriptiontext}{DESCRIPCIÃ“N}
      \renewcommand{\quantitytext}{CANT.}
      \renewcommand{\pricetext}{PRECIO}
      \renewcommand{\amounttext}{IMPORTE}
      \renewcommand{\subtotaltext}{BASE IMPONIBLE}
      \renewcommand{\totaltext}{TOTAL}
      \renewcommand{\vattext}{IVA}
      \renewcommand{\taxtext}{IRPF}
      \renewcommand{\contacttext}{Contacto}
      \renewcommand{\banktext}{Pago}
      \renewcommand{\outputamount}[1]{\num{#1}\currencysymbol}
      \sisetup{
        output-decimal-marker={,},
        group-separator={.},
      }
    }{}
  }

** Acknowledgements
This project is based on a template I downloaded some time ago.
Unfortunately, I have not been able to identify the original author--if
you are or know the creator, please let me know so I can give proper
credit.

I have simplified the code, use more standard LaTeX, improved
typesetting aesthetics, added =booktabs= support, and integrated Spanish
translation with =babel=.
